								<p>In order to understand user behavior and context, we conducted an online survey and three interviews with North Quad residence, did ten groups of field observation, and built an affinity diagram based on the notes from our interviews. According to our user study, we got four major findings. <br /><br />
								1. Users tend to go to the cafeteria with their friends rather than going alone. If they go by themselves, they would like to join their friends who are already in the cafeteria. <br /><br />
								2. People are willing to meet new people in the cafeteria, but they have trouble finding an ice breaker. <br /><br />
								3. The fact that people playing with mobile devices when they eat alone prevents them from communicate with people who they share a table with. <br /><br />
								4. People have the empathy of “familiar strangers”---- they’ve seen some people they are interested in now and then in the cafeteria, but they have no clue who they really are. </p>
