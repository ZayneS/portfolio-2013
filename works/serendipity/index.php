									<h3>EVOCATIVE STATEMENTS FROM USERS...</h3>
									<p>- “I don’t want to fall in love with something I can’t have.”- why Jessica shops online and whyshe filters her searches?</p>
									<p>- “The best part of shopping in store is finding something that you had no idea you wouldleave with… it’s like a present”- what she misses from in store shopping?</p>
									<p>- “I always hope I might be surprised”- why a male shopper goes to various departments in Target, when he did not plan on getting something from them.</p>
									<p>- "I love Nordstrom's because it has the best return policy you could imagine." But she won't shop online. "I have to try things on to make sure I like them." - a 32-year-old fashionista.</p>
									<p>- “Sometimes I just need someone to tell me what this all means! I like that there is someone to help me here” - a 28 yr old lady searching for a dress for black tie optional</p>

									<h3>INSIGHTS...</h3>
									<p>- Control is key to online shopping. Our user can shop when she wants and avoid the disappointment and embarrassment of in-store shopping.</p>
									<p>- Yet people are finding ways to make it similar to the in-store experience on their own. Our user has essentially begun creating her own at-home fitting room. She'll order two pairs of the same shoes in different sizes so she can try them on, and just send back what she doesn't like.</p>
									<p>- The next thing that's missing then from the in-store experience are those great little extra recommendations that Nordstrom's experts provide you with in the fitting room, a key thing that sets Nordstrom apart yet hasn't made it to the online experience.

									<h3>USERTESING & FEEDBACK...</h3>
									<p>All of our testers like the idea to delivery items home for free. Most of them are willing to try serendipity part, to let fashion experts to choose extra iterms for them. Only one man prefers do all selection by himself.</p>
									<p>During the testing, we also found testers thought the original brand: "fitting room to go" for the delivery box and "open to serendipity" for additional items are too much and isolated. We took their feedback and simplify the brand to just "Serendpity". </p>

									<h3>NEW QUESTIONS UNCOVERED...</h3>
									<p>How long is an appropriate amount to keep the clothing before having to return or thecard charged? </p>
									<p>How will items be selected? We definitely think that using the items purchased as abaseline is a great start, but there needs to be significant work done into determining thepricepoints for the items selected to be placed in the Nordstrom Serendipity box.</p>
									<p> Our design provides precious in-store experiences to Nordstrom online shopper, but can it also bring more customers into real Nordstrom store?</p>
