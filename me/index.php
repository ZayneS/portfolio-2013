									<h3>Hi...</h3>
									<p>I am looking for user experience or product design job starting in June 2014!</p>
									<p>Ok, this page reveals a little bit more about me:</p>
									<p>I was born in a small town named Yueyang in the central part of mainland China.</p>
									<p>I love painting and sketching, and I spent most of my after class time in painting studio from age 6 till I graduated from high school. I paved all four walls of my bedroom with my artworks.</p>
									<p>I was lucky to get in <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/index.html" target="_blank">Tsinghua University</a> for college and graduate school in an experimental direction of automotive design in mechanical engineering.</p>
									<p>However, automotive design itself was limited on beautifying the appearance of cars. I believed design should have spread interest, and with a more human-centered way. Thus I did many projects in a broad variety . During this period, I gradually realized the emerging significance of Human computer interaction. When digital technologies is changing human's life dramatically, interactive design smoothes such change with usability, delight and meaning.</p>
									<p>I know this is the design I feel excited about, and I will devote myself to. Then I quit from the Ph.D. program in <a href="http://www.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>, joined <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> to seek opporunities and knowledge from D.school, HCI direction and Management Science & Engineering department. I like this school, jump into projects, and enjoy every moment to learn skills and methods for design.</p>
									<p>I have many HCI and Design courses here, including: CS147 Intro to HCI, CS448b Data visualization, CS376 Research topics in HCI, CS438X Innovations in education, CS142 Web application, ME377 Design bootcamp, Comm269 Computers & interfaces.</p>
									<p>I started photographing at the fall of 2008. At that time I got my Nikon D90, which later I gave it to my dad. Now I am shooting with my Canon 6D.</p>
									<p>Thanks to my friend Xinpeng Huang, I am now learning Swing dance. Hope I can dance better soon!</p>
